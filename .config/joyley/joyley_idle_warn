"Hey, don’t leave me hanging... I’m about to shut off!"
"Just a few minutes before I go... don’t be idle!"
"Idle too long and I’ll be out of here... move something!"
"Got a few minutes left... don’t let me disconnect!"
"Don’t let me drift off... I’m nearly out of time!"
"Move around, or I’ll be shutting down soon!"
"I’m counting down to disconnection... stay active!"
"Only a few minutes before I’m gone... keep me awake!"
"Idle time’s running out... or it’s goodbye for now!"
"Last call before shutdown... don’t let me disconnect!"
