"Running a bit low here, mate!"
"Uh-oh, power’s dwindling!"
"Halfway there, need a boost soon!"
"Not quite full power, but I’m hanging in there!"
"Energy levels dipping, just a tad."
"Feeling a bit drained, but I’m still in the game!"
"Power’s slipping, could use a charge!"
"Running at half capacity, no worries!"
"Might need a little pick-me-up soon!"
"Battery’s getting a bit peckish!"
