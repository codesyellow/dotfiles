# Waybar Config

This Waybar is created to be as minimal as possible and focused on a two monitors setup. The main monitor is supossed to be simpler, so it just have the time and nothing else to avoid distraction, but the secondary monitor has everything else. Also it's design it's meant to be hand writen style.

## The following fonts are required

[Caviet](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Caveat?categoryFilters=Calligraphy:%2FScript%2FHandwritten)
[Monofur Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)

## Colorscheme
It's the [Gruvbox-Material](https://github.com/sainnhe/gruvbox-material).

## How to style?
I use Sass to make writing CSS easier. Do use you have to install [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/install/) first and than run *sass --watch style.scss style.css*.
